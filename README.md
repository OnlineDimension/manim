This is collection of scenes that I made using the manim library. I stitched many of these scenes together to create the presentation for my math PhD candidacy exam. For an 20x speed version with Chopin's ballade No. 1 in G minor playing in the background, I uploaded exactly that on my YouTube channel. It's my first project using manim. I am excited to create and upload more.
